# Social-Media-App
This project is based on a social media website, like Facebook.
For the layout I used a CSS framework, Boostrap.
Additional to that I used 2 Rest-APIs for data fetch with JavaScript, https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and https://reqres.in/
Finally I added a Log In page and also you can Log Out using a dedicaded icon in the navbar.
